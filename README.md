# KOHCTPYKTOP
A famous Zachtronics Industries game remake for WPF.

![Game screenshot](/screenshot2.png?raw=true)

So far it is largely work in progress, and not playable. Some features from the screenshot above are not even in the public branches yet. But we're progressing really quickly!

What we aim for is:

* a sandbox to test your designs
* a fully-operational level editor 
* support for any realistic size and topology of the chip
* if we get to know how the original game stores designs, maybe a way to import the original base64-encoded saves

We're doing this purely for fun, with no intention of making any profit from it.

If you're the author(s) of the original game: 

* If you are against the idea of this remake, just tell us so!
* If, on the other hand, you don't mind, tell us how to decode your design saves!
* Regardless, thank you for the game we had so much fun with!
